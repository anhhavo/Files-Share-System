# How to use the website:

The available usernames are:
- ahvo 
- mbustamante
- jmarch

After logging in with one of these usernames, you are able to upload, view, and delete a file. Each user has also the option to leave the file as private or to share with all users. If a new account is necessary, you can also create a new account. To logout, a logout button is shown on the bottom left of the page.      

# Creative Portion:

- Implemented a file sharing system, where everyone can share files with all users.
- Option to create a new account.
